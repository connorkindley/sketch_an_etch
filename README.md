This program aims to recreate a very popular physical game where you would turn two dials to draw a continuous line on a screen. 
If you wanted to start over, you would shake the device. 

Directions for the game are on the device when you run the program. W and S are used to move up or down, A or D is for left or right.
The arrow keys allow you to speed up the stylus in order to mimic turning the dial faster.
